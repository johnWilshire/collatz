Description: Take any positive integer n. 
  If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. 
  The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.
  
  This packages computes the number of operations a number takes in order to reach 1 (it's stopping time).
